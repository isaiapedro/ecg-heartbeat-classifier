## How to Run

<br>

With Docker installed, run Docker Desktop and the jupyter notebook image with the following command

<br>

```
docker run -it --rm -p 8888:8888 -v "${pwd}:/tf/notebooks" tensorflow/tensorflow:latest-jupyter
```
## Introduction

This repository was made to build a classifier that finds medical patterns based of eletrocardiografic signals with great precision, using the [MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Dataset and The PTB Diagnostic ECG Database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shayanfazeli/heartbeat).

<br/>

Later on, this model will be used to predict streamed medical data with the help of a database and the frameworks Spark Streaming and Kafka. The trustworthiness of the model will be tested using different datasets and improved according to state of the art practices.

## Conclusion

Thanks for reading up until here. I had a ton of fun doing this notebook and got a lot of useful insights on Convolution and how to setup a Neural Network with three hidden layers that acts like filters.
